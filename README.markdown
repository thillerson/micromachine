MicroMachine
============

Minimal Finite State Machine.

Description
-----------

There are many finite state machine implementations for Ruby, and they
all provide a nice DSL for declaring events, exceptions, callbacks,
and all kinds of niceties in general.

But if all you want is a finite state machine, look no further: this is only
22 lines of code and provides everything a finite state machine must have, and
nothing more.

Usage
-----

    require 'micromachine'

    machine = MicroMachine.new(:new) # Initial state.

    machine.transitions_for[:confirm] = { :new => :confirmed }
    machine.transitions_for[:ignore]  = { :new => :ignored }
    machine.transitions_for[:reset]   = { :confirmed => :new, :ignored => :new }

    machine.trigger(:confirm)  #=> true
    machine.trigger(:ignore)   #=> false
    machine.trigger(:reset)    #=> true
    machine.trigger(:ignore)   #=> true

Or you can save typing and declare that a transition can move from any other:

	crunk_machine = MicroMachine.new(:sober)
	crunk_machine.transitions_for[:sober]  = { :any => :sober }
	crunk_machine.transitions_for[:tipsy]  = { :sober => :tipsy }
	crunk_machine.transitions_for[:drunk]  = { :tipsy => :drunk }
	crunk_machine.transitions_for[:wasted] = { :drunk => :wasted }

    crunk_machine.state 			#=> :sober
    crunk_machine.trigger(:tipsy)	#=> true
    crunk_machine.trigger(:drunk)	#=> true
    crunk_machine.trigger(:wasted)	#=> true
    crunk_machine.trigger(:tipsy)	#=> false
    # walk it off
    crunk_machine.trigger(:sober)	#=> true
    crunk_machine.state 			#=> :sober

It can also have callbacks when entering some state:

    machine.on(:confirmed) do
      puts "Confirmed"
    end

Or callbacks on any transition:

    machine.on(:any) do
      puts "Transitioned..."
    end

Note that `:any` is a restricted key. Declaring a transition using the :any
key will raise an error.

Adding MicroMachine to your models
----------------------------------

The most popular pattern among Ruby libraries that tackle this problem
is to extend the model and transform it into a finite state machine.
Instead of working as a mixin, MicroMachine's implementation is by
composition: you instantiate a finite state machine (or many!) inside
your model and you are in charge of querying and persisting the state.
Here's an example of how to use it with an ActiveRecord model:

    class Event < ActiveRecord::Base
      before_save :persist_confirmation

      def confirm!
        confirmation.trigger(:confirm)
      end

      def cancel!
        confirmation.trigger(:cancel)
      end

      def reset!
        confirmation.trigger(:reset)
      end

      def confirmation
        @confirmation ||= begin
          @confirmation = MicroMachine.new(confirmation_state || "pending")
          @confirmation.transitions_for[:confirm] = { "pending" => "confirmed" }
          @confirmation.transitions_for[:cancel] = { "confirmed" => "cancelled" }
          @confirmation.transitions_for[:reset] = { "confirmed" => "pending", "cancelled" => "pending" }
          @confirmation
        end
      end

    private

      def persist_confirmation
        self.confirmation_state = confirmation.state
      end
    end

This example asumes you have a :confirmation_state attribute in your
model. This may look like a very verbose implementation, but you gain a
lot in flexibility.

An alternative approach, using callbacks:

    class Event < ActiveRecord::Base
      def confirm!
        confirmation.trigger(:confirm)
      end

      def cancel!
        confirmation.trigger(:cancel)
      end

      def reset!
        confirmation.trigger(:reset)
      end

      def confirmation
        @confirmation ||= begin
          confirmation = MicroMachine.new(confirmation_state || "pending")
          confirmation.transitions_for[:confirm] = { "pending" => "confirmed" }
          confirmation.transitions_for[:cancel] = { "confirmed" => "cancelled" }
          confirmation.transitions_for[:reset] = { "confirmed" => "pending", "cancelled" => "pending" }
          confirmation.on(:any) { self.confirmation_state = confirmation.state }
          confirmation
        end
      end
    end

Now, on any transition the `confirmation_state` attribute in the model will be updated.
